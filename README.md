#**Island Map Organizer for D&D (Windows)**

A small Windows app made to help Dungeon Masters organize campaign maps by islands and regions.
It was originally created for a personal sea-faring Dungeons & Dragons campaign, where keeping track of maps across multiple islands became difficult using folders alone.

Features
Sort and group maps by island
Group islands by campaigns
Simple desktop interface
Built for DMs running long or map-heavy campaigns
